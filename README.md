# Cricket Scoreboard System

Welcome to the Cricket Scoreboard System project! This project is designed to showcase the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts including graphical user interface (GUI), and file handling in Java. The system simulates a cricket scoreboard, allowing users to manage and display cricket match scores efficiently.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Graphical User Interface**: User-friendly GUI for managing and displaying scores.
- **File Handling**: Save and load match data to and from files.
- **Score Management**: Add, update, and display scores for different players and teams.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans)


## Usage

1. Compile and run the main program from your IDE.

2. Use the GUI to interact with the system. You can add new matches, update scores, and view the scoreboard.

3. Save match data to a file using the save option in the GUI.

4. Load match data from a file using the load option in the GUI.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the system:

- **Add Match**: Enter details for a new match, including teams, players, and initial scores.
- **View Scoreboard**: Display the current scoreboard for an ongoing match.
- **Save/Load Data**: Save match data to a file and load it later to continue updating scores.
